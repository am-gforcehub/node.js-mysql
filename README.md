### Description & Requirements
---
Bamazon is a command line node application that mimics an Amazon storefront.  By using MySQL and Node.js the app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

The following commands and the functions of these are noted below.

Commands | Function
---------|---------
bamazonCustomer.js  | this command takes in the data from the 'products' table in the 'bamazon_db' created in the MySQL database, and console logs the data onto the command line.  Then this command prompts questions for the user in regards to the  product they would like to purchase, from what department they would like to purchase it, and the quantity of how many they would like to have.  The command then prompts a question to the user to either confirm or cancel the purchase.

**Before you get started, make sure you have these node packages installed:**
1. **mysql:** a driver to access and perform with MySQL on the application.

     *Command Line: 'npm install mysql'*


2. **inquirer:** - A collection of common interactive command line user interfaces that allows the user to do the following: 
-**providing error feedback
-**asking questions
-**parsing input
-**validating answers
-**managing hierarchical prompts

     *Command Line: 'npm install inquirer'*
